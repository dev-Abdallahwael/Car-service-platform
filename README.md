** IMPLMENTAION ** 
The development of this project was carried out using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to ensure a responsive, functional, and interactive web application. The implementation environment includes the following technologies:
HTML5: Used for structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
CSS3: Applied for styling and visual design to ensure a consistent and appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Utilized to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the front end.
Bootstrap: Integrated to create a responsive design and speed up front-end development using pre-defined components and grid systems.
PHP (Native): Used as the server-side scripting language to handle backend logic, form submissions, and interaction with the database.
MySQL: Employed as the relational database management system for storing and managing all user, product, service, and booking data.
The project was developed and tested in a local environment using XAMPP as a development server stack, which provides Apache, PHP, and MySQL in one package. This environment allowed for efficient development, testing, and debugging before deployment.
